## discussed during meeting
- progress so far, both models completed but need to be tested
- glmnet_python package installation error occurs after re-installation of anaconda after updating OS system
  - attempted to solve it through numerous methods, appear to be a directory access/permission denied error
  - used instead the conda glmnet package, works but doesn't have features exhibited in glmnet_python, still prefer glmnet_python over the conda version
- as of now, still showing the same OS error, continue findng ways to solve it.


## tasks for this (next) week
- performance check: for the same lambda values, compare the performance of glmnet vs. lasso packages, including their performance, fit, percent deviation, etc.
- create a large random matrix to serve as X design matrix (somewhere in the scale of 10000x10000), set y vector as a random linear combination of few X's (aorund 4-5), check and compare coefficients and fit with existing data.
  - model should have relatively good performance since y is a linear combination of random X's
- create wrapper function to maintain consistency when using either models (glmnet or lasso)
- test runtime and memory usage to further compare the two models

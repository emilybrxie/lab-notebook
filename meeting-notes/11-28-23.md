## meeting notes
- discussed current progress on the pySINGE algorithm, and problems I ran into
- explained what the algorithm is doing again, specifically discussed what lag means and the components of each (design) matrix
  - "Input lag value as an array of values, find max lag value, look at max lag value + 1 onwards to the end is the y (target value). X is from 0 to (last value-max lag)"
- decided to start from creating a function that takes expression data and lag as input and provide the (stacked) predicted coefficient matrix as output:

## plans ahead
- DONE---finish the function that outputs a stacked coefficient matrix as discussed in meeting. ("lasso_lag_input.py", tested in "testing.py" under data-and-scripts/scripts repo)
- then, account for the time element (this is an irregular time series) by building on top of the aforementioned function. In order for regression to work, need a kernel for the X design matrix to smooth out the time (due to the lag, time isn't necessarily integers, or exact time point isn't recorded on the data). Need to build the kernel using Gaussian function, then find the weighted averages of each column before applying it to X and then the regression.
  - "Find y matrix and its corresponding time points, apply lag, find kernel for X at the ytime-lag time points, apply it to X"
  - "After finding the kernel matrix, make sure each column has a sum of 1 (sum each column, divide each element of the column by this sum)"

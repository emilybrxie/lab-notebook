## things discussed during meeting
- try running JHPCE: upload previous files I have (python, R scripts), submit to run on JHPCE, check the output and error files to make sure it's running correctly
- run SINGE on matlab, using subfunction (iLasso), results should match up with pySINGE timed_lagg
  - when running Matlab SINGE, input number of lags and delta t (instead of a list of lags), and lags will automatically generate
  - use "X_SCODE" data, contains expression data and time data
- set m = matfile("input.mat") as a pointer, then pass it into iLasso_for_SINGE in matlab to run
- make sure that the Am and bm are the same
- kernel width = sigma in the kernel input parameter
- 


## tasks for the upcoming week
- run SINGE and the matlab version, compare to make sure the results match with each other (matrix dimensions)
- try running some batches of R and Python code on JHPCE

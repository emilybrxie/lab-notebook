## discussed during meeting
- .gitignore files to ignore certain unnecessary files when adding and committing from local repo
- glmnet package in Python, seems to be a better fit for our problem, likely more efficient
- how submodules branching work
- how forking works, better practice to fork repos and work on them under my own repo
- branch-related commands in github:
  - to access a branch: **git checkout branchname**
  - to create a new branch from the current branch: **git checkout -b branchname**




## tasks for this (and next week)
- finish developing and testing sklearn-lasso and glmnet-lasso models
- create wrapper functions and measure model efficiency with runtime and ram-usage
- create .gitignore file for the repo

## meeting notes
- fixed glmnet_py installation issue by:
  - installing miniforge using "homebrew install miniforge"
  - creating new virtual environment on python 3.6 with glmnet_py package using "conda create --name pyenv -c conda-forge glmnet_py python=3.6"
  - activate new environment on terminal and anaconda for jupyter notebook
- going over plans for the final part of the semester (see plans below)
  

## plans for final project
- next thing: use glmnet in SINGE context:
  - need matrix am
  - parameter controls: what function to pass, what largest lambda value to pass, threshold value to determine convergence
  - main inputs: expression data (X) in psuedotime series (1 closer to stem cell, 100 closer to endoderm)
- essentially, expression data is should be ordered in temporal sequence. User enters expected y's width and the time interval (every 5, every 10, etc.). For every gene, break X values into temporal pieces of entered width and run regression of this piece of X vs. y. , then move to the next piece of X, etc. Run glmnet for NxM times in total. At the end, compare coefficients of each piece of X vs. y, find the most optimal piece (time interval most similar/predict the y expression).

- replace numpy (which runs on CPU) with a compatible package that runs on GPU (CuPy perhaps?)

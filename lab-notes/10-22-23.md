## Tasks completed/in progress this week
- finished & debugged glmnet regression: program would not execute initially due to my wrong interpretation of the equation & used the names of genes as the y variable. Realized that it does not make sense logically. To fix this, I created a Nx1 "target cells" variable and tested it with a matrix of random floats between 0 and 100. These are the input variables of the glm regression function:

  - not sure if "target cell" is the correct interpretation of the y variable. I understand that X is the expression data, but am not sure what exactly y should be.
- After my computer updated last week, have not been able to run the program using glmnet_python due to an package installation issue, where it keeps on reporting an OS ERROR:

  - I've been trying to fix this pacakge installation issue for a few days now, tried every solution I could find on stackoverflow but have not succeeded thus far. I've attempted to uninstall & reinstall package on both the virtual environment and in my local directory, either worked. I also tried to install using fortran, also did not work out. I could not run this program further without solving this installation issue (that appeared only after I updated my mac system).


## Tasks planned for next week
- HAVE TO figure out how to fix this package issue, otherwise could not proceed with the program improvement process.
- Discuss with Atul what the next step would be, have not made significant progress with algorithm development.

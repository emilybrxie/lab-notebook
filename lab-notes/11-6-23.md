## Tasks completed/in progress this week
- cotinued trying to figure out intallation of glmnet_py on anaconda, have tried numerious methods (including conda install, which isn't working because the package is only available for Python 3.6-3.7, as well as brew install which doesn't include the glmnet package)
- In the mean time, worked on the sklearn LASSO regression model instead. The regression outputs the best lambda (which is named alpha in this pakcage), the lambdas that were used for fitting, and the fitted sparse coefficients of the regression, as well as the runtime. However, unable to quantiy percent deviation and other measures of fit due to limitations of this package.
  - Results from running a 100 gene x 365 cells data (X_SCODE):

- Tested the sklearn Lasso regression with random 10000x10000 matrix X and random linear combination of 5 x's as y, results are as expected, but runtime is extremely slow.

## Tasks planned for next week
- figure out ways to evaluate the fit of the model in sklearn's LASSO 
- when installation of glmnet_py is successful, run the comparison between it and LASSO regression
- create wrapper function for these two packages, so they are easily replacable later on.

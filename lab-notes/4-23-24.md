## progress for the week
1. fixed the unnecessary loop in lasso_timed_lag, replaced the algorithm for finding max time index with python's np.where
2. worked on fixing the matrix kernel, have yet to figure out the issue, so worked on creating the larger lasso regression instead
3. expanded the lasso regression to every gene in the expression data for each time lag. (i.e. running lasso_time_lag on each gene in the data and compiling all the coefficients into matrices ordered by time lag, as well as a separate array of contants from each gene)
   - still need to make sure that user can enter any number of lags, and the program would be able to accomodate that (right now, it's set to 3 but will work on changing that to not hardcoding)
   - lasso_all_genes.py
   - run-time is very slow, is there a way to get rid of the looping structure? (can't think of one right now)


## things planned for next week
1. continue working on lasso_all_genes to make sure it works for any number of lags
2. check with Atul if the type of output is ok (list of numpt arrays, a numpy array, etc.)
3. continue figuring out the kernel situation, make sure standardization is right
4. semester is approaching its end, how to wrap this semester up, plans for the summer, etc.

## progress this week
- finished lasso_all_genes function, not hard coded, can be applied for any number of lags/length of lags
  - has a double loop inside function, computationally intensive
  - for data with 100 genes and 365 cells, run time is as follows:
    - for the entire lasso_all_genes program: 70.93663 seconds
    - for the double loop within: 70.93661 seconds
- testing more runtime of all the pieces within the lasso_all_genes function:
  - the lasso_timed_lag, which runs the regression on one single gene, has a runtime of 0.7391 seconds for a 100x365 expression data
  - the gaussian_kernel, which is inside lasso_timed_lag and looped for n_lag of times, has a runtime of 0.209 seconds per run
  - so, kernel takes 0.59288 sec in total, about 80% of the total program runtime
- going back to one gene lasso, verifying if the bm values match up with the Matlab version
  - I ran the Matlab version, and the bm has a dimension of 265x1, while the python version has 301x1 (one constant, 100 genes x 3 time lags), so I'm not sure why the dimensions differ so much between the two. Not sure where is inconsistent since the Am dimensions match up.
  - Am, after kernel, have different numbers, which means the kernel is not correct
  - The kernel appears logically correct to me, so it could be how it was used in the single gene lasso program, still figuring it out
 

  ## tasks for next week
- continue on fixing the kernel
- how to optimize kernel?

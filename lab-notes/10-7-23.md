## Tasks completed/in progress this week ##
- To better organize files and create structure within the repository, created submodules "lab-notebook", "data-and-scripts", and "pySINGE" within the main repository EN.553.500_09.
	- ![image](https://github.com/emilybrxie/lab-notebook/assets/98119821/3d0317ea-58bf-4b9c-8931-62c4b8535e10)

- Explores Markdown syntax in github, attempted to write lab notes within github using the Markdown syntax, including listing and inserting images
- Debugging the lasso regression algorithm, testing with data
	- referenced following page: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html#sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.sparse_coef_
- Created another version of lasso regression using Python's glmnet function:
  	- using glmnet.ElasticNet and glmnet.Lasso, generate fitted values for given gene_list and expression_data
  	- referenced following pages for glmnet:
  	  	- https://notebook.community/ceholden/glmnet-python/examples/glmnet_demo
  	  	- https://glmnet-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glmnet_vignette.html



## Tasks planned for next week ##
- Finish the lasso regression model algorithm
- Continue exploring glmnet in Python and how to incorporate it into the current model as a function, as well as other features of the package
  	- potentially: explore plotting features and how to optimize the current regressions

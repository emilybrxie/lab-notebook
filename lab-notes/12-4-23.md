## Tasks completed/in progress this week
- incorporated the time element into the lasso algorithm from last week, where we assumed time was not a factor yet. This was based on last week's explanation of the algorithm
- see "lasso_timed_lag.ipynb" (https://github.com/emilybrxie/data-and-scripts/blob/main/scripts/lasso_timed_lag.ipynb) 
- built in a Gaussian kernel function for smoothing and filling-in of the X matrix at timepoints specified by the target gene matrix, also located in "lasso_timed_lag.ipynb"
- question that came up:
  1. As of now, the kernel function is very general, not sure if it's supposed to be more specified for each X-design matrix created based on the corresponding y matrix?
  2. Right now, it's assumed that time_data is of the same dimension as the X_expression data (with each data point's index the same as its corresponding time in time_data). Is that a correct assumption? Is it possible for time_data to be of different dimension than the expression data?


## Tasks planned for next week
- need to STANDADIZE kernel (elements in a column sum up to 1) by a weighted average
- test on available larger data sets

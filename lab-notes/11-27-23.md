## Tasks completed/in progress this week
- began working on lasso_for_pySINGE, which uses glmnet regression to find the most suitable/optimal piece of cell-gene expression, based on user input preferences
- some questions that came up:
  1. how exactly is the pseudotime element manifested in this algorithm? I'm not sure if I've correctly implemented the loops in terms of how excactly the expression matrix is structured---would be nice to see an example dataset
  2. how should I evaluate whether if a piece of data is optimal (in comparison to the target expression piece)? i.e. what would be a good measure of fit in this case? Perhaps % deviation or number of expressions correctly predicted/error?
  3. the general structure is implemented, but I'm still a little confused on how the data is structured (which, in terms, would affect how I design the loops)


## Tasks planned for next week
- continue working on this algorithm, aim to have it working by next meeting and have a finished product by Dec 13 (end of semester, beginning of finals)
- set more specific, achievable goals for myself throughout the week to prevent last-minute procrastination and ensure higher efficiency.

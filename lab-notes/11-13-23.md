## Tasks completed/in progress this week
- created wrapper function that encompasses the lasso/glmnet functionality. Sklearn's LASSO is implemented currently, though it can be swapped out for glmnet easily. General function inputs and outputs are specified.
- continued seeking for solutions to glmnet package installation

## Tasks planned for next week
- Right now, running large matrix on the LASSO program is difficult and often crashes my computer (have to restart every time), need to figure out a potential solution to this.
- what's next? What's the plan for final project/paper/or something else?
